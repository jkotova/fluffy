# Inspiration
We wanted to solve 1st global prophet for Kalahari Conservational Society, started to research the topic and realised that that most communication media tools (apps, websites, etc.) for current solutions are very outdated, buggy and have limited functionality.

# What it does
Itâ€™s a system template that can be used by any nature conservation organization to collect users reports and react on it.
